# Airbnb Clone Project

## Project Overview

This project is a simplified clone of the Airbnb platform, built for educational purposes. It allows users to browse listings, book stays, and manage their accounts.

## Project Goals

-   Understand full-stack web development
-   Learn how to build scalable web applications
-   Practice collaborative development with Git and GitHub

## Tech Stack

-   **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
-   **Backend:** Python (Flask or Django)
-   **Database:** PostgreSQL
-   **Version Control:** Git & GitHub

## Team Roles

### 1. Backend Developer

Responsible for building and maintaining the server-side logic of the application. Ensures smooth communication between the database and frontend. Manages APIs, authentication, and application logic.

### 2. Frontend Developer

Designs and implements the visual components of the application that users interact with. Works with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript frameworks to create responsive and intuitive user interfaces.

### 3. Database Administrator (DBA)

Manages the project's database system. Ensures data integrity, security, backups, and performance optimization. Designs schemas and writes complex queries as needed.

### 4. DevOps Engineer

Sets up the infrastructure for development, testing, and deployment. Automates CI/CD pipelines, monitors system performance, and ensures high availability and scalability.

### 5. Project Manager

Oversees the entire project, coordinates between team members, sets deadlines, and ensures that goals are met. Acts as the main point of contact between the technical team and stakeholders.

### 6. UI/UX Designer

Focuses on the look and feel of the product. Designs user-friendly and accessible interfaces, creates wireframes and prototypes, and collaborates closely with frontend developers.

### 7. Quality Assurance (QA) En

## Technology Stack

### Django

A high-level Python web framework used to build secure, scalable, and maintainable web applications. In this project, Django is used for managing backend logic, handling HTTP requests, and building RESTful APIs.

### PostgreSQL

An advanced open-source relational database system. It is used to store and manage structured data like user profiles, listings, and bookings in a reliable and efficient way.

### GraphQL

A query language for APIs that enables clients to request exactly the data they need. It allows for more flexible and efficient communication between the frontend and backend compared to traditional REST APIs.

### HTML5

The standard markup language for structuring web content. Used for creating the structure and layout of the frontend pages.

### CSS3

A style sheet language used for describing the presentation of HTML documents. It is used to design and style the user interface.

### JavaScript

A programming language that enables interactive features on the frontend, such as dynamic content updates and form validation.

### Git & GitHub

Git is a version control system for tracking changes in source code. GitHub is a platform for hosting and collaborating on Git repositories. Both are used for managing project code, tracking progress, and enabling team collaboration.

### Docker (optional)

Used to containerize the application and its services, making it easier to deploy and maintain consistent environments across development and production.
